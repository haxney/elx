;;; Commentary:

;; This library extracts information from Emacs Lisp libraries.

;; This extends library `lisp-mnt', which is only suitable for libraries
;; that closely follow the header conventions.  Unfortunately there are
;; many libraries that do not - this library tries to cope with that.

;; This library is also able to extract some values that `lisp-mnt' can't.
;; Most notably this library can extract the features required and
;; provided by a file or group of files.  Libraries `load-hist' and
;; `lib-requires' provide similar functionality by inspecting
;; `load-history' and thus require the inspected library to be loaded.

;; This library on the other hand uses regexp search in the respective
;; files making it unnecessary to load them first.  This means that the
;; `require' and `provide' have to satisfy certain restrictions (see
;; `elx-required' and `elx-provided') and features required or provided
;; by other means are not recognized.  But this is very rare, and this
;; library has the advantage that it can be used even when the required
;; features can't be loaded (because the providing libraries are not
;; available) or when one doesn't want to load them for security reasons.

;; Some of the features implemented here will hopefully be merged into
;; `lisp-mnt.el' once I find the time to create patches.
